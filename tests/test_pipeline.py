"""Pipeline contract — Detection -> Tracker -> Fence -> ANPR -> HashChain.

ROADMAP §5.3 asks for exactly this: a check that the module contract still
holds after a model swap. Fine-tuned weights shift confidence
distributions, which can change what reaches the tracker and therefore what
reaches the fence, so these tests pin the *wiring* — that a detection which
crosses a fence produces an intrusion, an alert, and a chain record, in
that order — independently of which checkpoint is loaded.

The detector is stubbed. Real detection quality is a metric
(scripts/evaluate.py), not an assertion.
