# BorderEye Demo Script & Talking Points

## Demo Overview

**Duration:** 7-8 minutes total (5 min demo + 2-3 min Q&A prep)
**Setup:** Single laptop + projector/screen
**Files needed:** Pre-recorded video clips, running dashboard, terminal for hash demo

---

## Opening Hook (30 seconds)

**[Show slide: "Every AI-CCTV platform on the market assumes good bandwidth, good cameras, and infinite trust in every alert. Border posts have none of those three."]**

> "Every AI-CCTV platform on the market assumes good bandwidth, good cameras, and infinite trust in every alert. Border posts have none of those three. BORDEREYE is the first platform designed for the actual constraint — not the demo constraint."

**Why this works:** Judges have seen 5+ teams pitch "YOLO + Tesseract OCR + a dashboard" today. This immediately signals you understood the *background* section, not just the expected solution checklist.

---

## Problem Statement Re-framing (45 seconds)

**[Show slide: "What's Actually Wrong with the Obvious Solution"]**

| What everyone else pitches | Why it breaks at a real BOP |
|---|---|
| Stream video to cloud for AI | Border posts have thin, intermittent links. Full HD streams choke. |
| Detect everything, alert on everything | False-positive fatigue is #1 reason surveillance tech gets switched off |
| Claim FRS works like day/night | Physics: no IR hardware = near-zero signal at night. Overclaiming collapses. |
| "Support C2 integration" as a checkbox | Nobody defined *how*. Unfalsifiable claims lose technical depth points. |
| Single-frame ANPR | Border plates are angled, blurred, low-res. Single-frame OCR fails constantly. |

> "We didn't start with 'what AI model should we use.' We started with 'what actually fails when you deploy this at a real border post?' That's why we designed a three-tier system."

## Architecture Walkthrough (90 seconds)

**[Show architecture diagram slide]**

### Tier 1 — High-priority BOP (has power + some connectivity)
> "At a well-equipped check post, we deploy a Jetson Orin Nano — about $150. It runs detection, tracking, ANPR, and virtual fence locally. Only compact event metadata travels upstream — not video."

### Tier 2 — Remote border-road camera (no compute budget)
> "At remote cameras with no dedicated hardware, we use a $20-30 microcontroller doing frame-differencing. On motion trigger, it buffers a short clip locally and forwards it when a link appears. Analytics run at the nearest Tier-1 edge node. This is the 'no dedicated hardware' tier — under $50 total added cost."

### Tier 3 — Command Center
> "All events aggregate here — map-based dashboard, cross-camera correlation, tamper-evident audit log, and C2 integration via MQTT. Store-and-forward everywhere — the system never goes silent just because the network did."

**Key line to say out loud:** *"A Tier-2 site costs under $50 in added hardware; a Tier-1 site costs under $250 — both are an order of magnitude cheaper than proprietary FRS/ANPR camera systems, which is the actual ask in the problem statement."*

## Live Demo Sequence (3-4 minutes)

### Demo 1: Human + Vehicle Detection/Tracking (60 seconds)

**[Play pre-recorded video of YOLOv8-nano running on a border CCTV feed]**

> "Running YOLOv8-nano on edge hardware, we detect and track people and vehicles in real-time. Each object gets a persistent track ID that follows it across frames."

**Talking point:** "This runs on a laptop for demo purposes. On a Jetson Orin Nano, it achieves 25+ FPS on 1080p input — real-time for surveillance."

---

### Demo 2: Virtual Fence Intrusion (60 seconds)

**[Show dashboard with a polygon drawn on the video feed, then an object crossing it]**

> "An operator draws a virtual fence — a polygon on the frame. The instant a tracked object's centroid crosses that boundary, we fire an alert with full context: track ID, speed, bearing, zone, and *why* it fired."

**[Show alert on dashboard with explanation field]**

> "Notice the 'explanation' field. The operator sees *why* it fired, not just a bounding box. This is our answer to the false-positive fatigue problem."

---

### Demo 3: ANPR with Multi-Frame Consensus (60 seconds)

**[Play video of vehicle approaching camera at an angle, with OCR results from multiple frames]**

> "Single-frame OCR on border plates fails constantly — the plate is angled, blurred, low-resolution. We run OCR across several consecutive frames of the same tracked vehicle and take the majority-vote plate string. This is realistic, working, and genuinely better than single-frame in front of judges."

**[Show consensus voting UI: Frame 1: "BR 12 AB 3456", Frame 2: "BR 12 AB 3458", Frame 3: "BR 12 AB 3456" → Final: "BR 12 AB 3456" (2/3 agreement)]**

---

### Demo 4: Signal-Loss Alerting (45 seconds)

**[Kill a camera feed live, show dashboard immediately flagging it]**

> "Now watch what happens when a camera feed goes down."

**[Dashboard shows: "Camera 3: SIGNAL LOST — High Severity"]**

> "Signal loss is itself an alert. A blinded or jammed camera triggers escalation, not silence. This is a 20-minute build with outsized impact on security credibility."

**Talking point:** "This is the single most field-credible line in our pitch. In real deployments, cameras get vandalized, cables get cut, signals get jammed. If the system goes silent, it's useless. We make silence itself an alert."

---

### Demo 5: Tamper-Evident Log (30 seconds)

**[Show terminal with hash chain verification]**

> "Each event record includes a SHA-256 hash of the previous record. If anyone edits a past record, the chain breaks."

**[Run 10-line Python script showing chain verification and tamper detection]**

```python
import hashlib, json
events = load_events()
for i in range(1, len(events)):
    prev = hashlib.sha256(json.dumps(events[i-1]['data']).encode()).hexdigest()
    if prev != events[i]['prev_hash']:
        print(f"TAMPER DETECTED at event {i}")
        break
else:
    print("Chain intact — no tampering")
```

> "10 lines of code. But it answers a question every security judge will ask: 'how do we know nobody edited the logs?'"

---

## Closing Slide (30 seconds)

**[Show slide: "Built for the actual constraint — not the demo constraint."]**

> "We designed BORDEREYE for the actual constraints of border deployment — low bandwidth, legacy hardware, false-positive fatigue, and security. Every feature we built addresses a real failure mode, not a theoretical one. We're ready to deploy, and we're ready to answer any questions."

## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: "What about night detection?"**
> "Without IR/thermal hardware, we don't claim face-level ID at night — that's a sensor-physics limit, not a software gap. What we provide: low-light frame enhancement plus motion-silhouette detection, which reliably flags 'something moved in Zone X at 2 AM' even when identity can't be confirmed. That's still a major upgrade over a human watching a dark monitor."

**Q: "How does behavioral baseline learning work?"**
> "New sites start in a conservative 'alert everything' mode for a defined window. A human confirms or rejects events to seed the baseline. After that window, the system learns what's normal — patrol patterns, vehicle frequency, pedestrian movement — and only escalates deviations. This also prevents an adversary from slowly 'normalizing' an intrusion pattern."

**Q: "How do you handle false positives?"**
> "Three mechanisms: (1) the behavioral baseline filters out routine activity, (2) each alert includes an explanation field so operators can quickly assess relevance, and (3) the severity system lets operators prioritize — a fence intrusion at 2 AM is high severity; a vehicle passing during patrol hours is low."

**Q: "What's the latency?"**
> "Virtual fence intrusion: under 3 seconds end-to-end. Vehicle/ANPR match: under 15 seconds (consensus voting needs a short window). Behavioral deviation: under 30 seconds. Signal loss: under 5 seconds."

**Q: "How does this integrate with existing C2 systems?"**
> "We use MQTT — already the standard for low-bandwidth IoT and defense telemetry. The JSON event schema we showed is the integration contract. Any C2 system that can subscribe to MQTT topics can consume our alerts."

**Q: "What about data privacy and governance?"**
> "Built-in role-based access, configurable retention policies, and the tamper-evident audit trail we demonstrated. FRS and ANPR data near a national border is legally sensitive — we addressed this proactively, not as an afterthought."

**Q: "What's the cost?"**
> "Tier-1 site: under $250 in added hardware. Tier-2 site: under $50. Both are an order of magnitude cheaper than proprietary FRS/ANPR systems. The software is open-source; the cost is in the edge hardware and deployment labor."

## Presentation Tips

- **Practice the demo 5+ times.** Technical demos fail in front of judges. Pre-record fallback videos.
- **Time yourself.** 5 minutes is strict. Cut ruthlessly.
- **Don't read slides.** Talk to the judges, not the screen.
- **Have one person drive the demo, another narrate.** Two people minimum.
- **Bring a backup laptop.** Your primary will fail at the worst moment.
- **Print the alert schema and hash chain code.** Judges may want to see it up close.
- **Know your cost numbers cold.** "$250 for Tier-1, $50 for Tier-2" — say it without looking.
