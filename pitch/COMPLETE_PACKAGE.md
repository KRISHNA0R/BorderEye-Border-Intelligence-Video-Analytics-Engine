# BorderEye — SIH 2026 Complete Package

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**BORDEREYE (Intelligent Border Video Analytics Platform)** is a tiered, bandwidth-honest, alert-that-can-be-trusted surveillance software layer for existing CCTV systems, designed specifically for border security deployments.

**Core Innovation:** Every AI-CCTV platform assumes good bandwidth, good cameras, and infinite trust in every alert. Border posts have none of those three. BORDEREYE is the first platform designed for the actual constraint.

**Winning Formula:**
```
WINNING = Clear Problem + Working Demo + Honest Claims + Confident Delivery
```

## 🎤 Presentation Strategy

### The One-Liner (Memorize This)
> "Every AI-CCTV platform on the market assumes good bandwidth, good cameras, and infinite trust in every alert. Border posts have none of those three. BORDEREYE is the first platform designed for the actual constraint — not the demo constraint."

### 5-Minute Pitch Structure

| Time | Slide | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| 0:00-0:30 | Title + One-Liner | Hook judges with the constraint |
| 0:30-1:00 | Problem Statement | What's wrong with obvious solutions |
| 1:00-1:30 | Our Solution | Three-tier architecture with costs |
| 1:30-3:00 | **Live Demo** | Virtual fence → ANPR → Signal loss → Hash chain |
| 3:00-3:30 | Why This Wins | Six differentiators |
| 3:30-4:00 | Tech Stack | YOLOv8 + ByteTrack + MQTT + FastAPI |
| 4:00-4:30 | Roadmap + Close | What's built vs what's planned |

### Demo Sequence (The Money Shot)
1. **Virtual Fence Intrusion** (60 sec) — Draw polygon, object crosses, alert fires with explanation
2. **ANPR with Multi-Frame Consensus** (60 sec) — Show single-frame failure vs our voting
3. **Signal-Loss Alerting** (45 sec) — Kill camera feed, dashboard flags it immediately
4. **Tamper-Evident Log** (30 sec) — Show hash chain verification script

**Critical:** Pre-record backup video for every demo segment. Practice 5+ times.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

### Three-Tier System

| Tier | Hardware | Cost | Capabilities |
|------|----------|------|--------------|
| **Tier 1** | Jetson Orin Nano | $150-250 | Full AI: detection, tracking, ANPR, virtual fence |
| **Tier 2** | Microcontroller | $20-30 | Frame-differencing, buffer, forward when linked |
| **Tier 3** | Command Center | — | Aggregate, correlate, alert, C2 integration |

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Detection:** YOLOv8-nano (45 FPS on $150 Jetson, 85%+ mAP)
- **Tracking:** ByteTrack (persistent track IDs across frames)
- **ANPR:** PaddleOCR + multi-frame consensus voting
- **Transport:** MQTT (IoT standard, low-bandwidth, already used in defense)
- **Backend:** FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Dashboard:** React + Leaflet maps
- **Security:** SHA-256 hash chain + RBAC

## 🎯 Judging Criteria Alignment

| Criterion | Weight | Our Approach |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Problem Understanding** | 20% | Lead with "border posts have no bandwidth" |
| **Innovation** | 20% | Signal-loss-as-alert, explainable alerts, honest claims |
| **Technical Feasibility** | 20% | Live demo of working prototype |
| **Impact & Scalability** | 20% | $250/Tier-1 vs $10K proprietary |
| **Presentation Quality** | 20% | Clear, honest, demo-driven |

## 📋 What's Built vs Roadmap

### Built and Demo-Ready
1. ✅ Human + vehicle detection/tracking (YOLOv8-nano)
2. ✅ Virtual fence intrusion detection
3. ✅ ANPR with multi-frame OCR consensus
4. ✅ Alert dashboard with map view
5. ✅ Signal-loss alerting
6. ✅ Tamper-evident hash chain log

### Designed, Demo as Mock/Roadmap
7. 🔄 Face detection → identity match (full FRS needs IR hardware)
8. 🔄 Behavioral baseline learning (show mechanism, not weeks of training)
9. 🔄 Cross-camera correlation (heuristic v1, not full re-ID)
10. 🔄 C2 system integration (show JSON payload + MQTT structure)

## 🗣️ Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions

**Q: "What about night detection?"**
> "Without IR/thermal hardware, we don't claim face-level ID at night — that's a sensor-physics limit, not a software gap. What we provide: low-light frame enhancement plus motion-silhouette detection, which reliably flags 'something moved in Zone X at 2 AM' even when identity can't be confirmed."

**Q: "How do you handle false positives?"**
> "Three mechanisms: (1) behavioral baseline filters out routine activity, (2) each alert includes an explanation field, (3) severity system lets operators prioritize."

**Q: "What's the latency?"**
> "Virtual fence: <3 sec. ANPR: <15 sec. Behavioral deviation: <30 sec. Signal loss: <5 sec."

**Q: "How does this integrate with existing C2 systems?"**
> "MQTT — already the standard for low-bandwidth IoT and defense telemetry. The JSON event schema is the integration contract."

**Q: "What about data privacy?"**
> "Built-in RBAC, configurable retention policies, and tamper-evident audit trail. FRS and ANPR data near a national border is legally sensitive — we addressed this proactively."

**Q: "What's the cost?"**
> "Tier-1: under $250. Tier-2: under $50. Both are an order of magnitude cheaper than proprietary FRS/ANPR systems."

## 🏆 Winning Formula

```
WINNING = Clear Problem + Working Demo + Honest Claims + Confident Delivery

Clear Problem:    "Border posts have no bandwidth, no modern cameras, 
                   and guards ignore every alert"

Working Demo:     Virtual fence → alert → explanation (3 seconds)

Honest Claims:    "Night FRS needs IR hardware — we don't fake it"

Confident:        Every team member speaks, every answer has a reason
```

## 🎨 Key Differentiators to Emphasize

1. **Signal-loss-as-alert** — nobody else thinks of this
2. **Explainable alerts** — not just bounding boxes
3. **Honest night limits** — stating the limit proactively reads as competence
4. **Store-and-forward** — never goes silent
5. **Tamper-evident log** — security credibility
6. **Cost analysis** — $250/Tier-1 vs $10K proprietary

## 🎯 Key Phrases to Memorize

1. **Opening:** "Every AI-CCTV platform assumes good bandwidth, good cameras, and infinite trust in every alert."

2. **Architecture:** "Only metadata travels upstream, never video."

3. **Cost:** "A Tier-1 site costs under $250; a Tier-2 site costs under $50 — both are 10x cheaper than proprietary systems."

4. **Signal Loss:** "Signal loss is itself an alert. A blinded camera triggers escalation, not silence."

5. **Honesty:** "Without IR hardware, we don't claim face-level ID at night — that's a sensor-physics limit, not a software gap."

6. **Close:** "BORDEREYE — designed for the actual constraint, not the demo constraint."
