## 2. Dataset Catalog

### 2.1 Priority Datasets (for fine-tuning)

| Priority | Dataset | Purpose | Size | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **IDD (Indian Driving Dataset)** — Detection subset | Person/vehicle detection on Indian roads | ~2.5 GB | Directly matches deployment domain — Indian roads, mixed traffic, non-Western vehicle types (autos, tempos) that COCO-pretrained YOLO under-detects |
| **2** | **Kaggle plate sets** (see §2.4) + **UFPR-ALPR** | Plate localizer fine-tuning | ~0.4 GB obtained | Current ANPR uses classical CV for plate localization — weakest accuracy component; trained YOLO plate-detector fixes it directly |
| **3** | **ExDark** | Low-light detection robustness | ~0.8 GB | Answers the "honest night claim" — model trained on dark imagery raises real detection confidence at night |

### 2.2 All Cataloged Datasets

| Dataset | Short | Category | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Indian Driving Dataset | IDD | Vehicle Detection | 2.5 GB | Priority 1 |
| IDD Temporal | IDD-T | Temporal Tracking | 5.0 GB | Cut for now |
| IITM-HeTra | IITM | Surveillance | 1.2 GB | Cut for now |
| Indian Number Plates | INP | ANPR | 3.0 GB | Priority 2 |
| UFPR-ALPR | UFPR | ANPR | 1.5 GB | Priority 2 |
| VIRAT | VIRAT | Surveillance | 50.0 GB | Cut (too large) |
| MEVA | MEVA | Surveillance | 470.0 GB | Cut (too large) |
| UCF-Crime | UCF | Anomaly | 15.0 GB | Cut for now |
| ExDark | ExDark | Low Light | 0.8 GB | Priority 3 |
| BDD100K | BDD | Vehicle Tracking | 100.0 GB | Cut (too large) |
| WIDER FACE | WIDER | Face Detection | 3.5 GB | Optional |
| Custom Border | — | Custom | TBD | Not collected yet |

### 2.4 Corrections found when actually fetching the data

Two entries in the table above were wrong, discovered only by downloading:

- **"Indian Number Plates (DataCluster Labs)" is not 10,000 images.** What
  Kaggle hosts (`dataclusterlabs/indian-number-plates-dataset`) is a free
  *sample* of a commercial product: **47 annotated images** — 27 full
  photos plus 21 OCR crops. Useful as domain-matched data, but it is not a
  training set on its own. The bulk of the plate data therefore comes from
  `andrewmvd/car-plate-detection` (433 images, CC0), giving **460 images
  total** after merging.
- **IDD does *not* require the manual signup** at idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in
  that earlier notes claimed. Kaggle carries mirrors, and
  `redzapdos123/indian-driving-dataset-detections-yolov11` ships
  IDD-Detection **already in YOLO format** with a data.yaml — no
  conversion step needed at all. It is 21.9 GB.

### 2.3 Explicitly Cut (state as future work)

- **VIRAT** (50 GB) — not realistically downloadable or trainable in timeframe
- **MEVA** (470 GB) — same
- **BDD100K** (100 GB) — same
- **UCF-Crime** — anomaly detection is a different pipeline, not our focus
- **IITM-HeTra** — overhead CCTV, different camera angle than border deployment
- **IDD-Temporal** — temporal consistency is P2 work
- **Custom Border** — doesn't exist yet; collecting it is a multi-week program

## 3. Preprocessing Pipeline

All priority datasets converge on **one unified YOLO format** so a single fine-tuning run can consume them.

### 3.1 Target Directory Structure

```
data/
  detection/
    images/{train,val}/*.jpg
    labels/{train,val}/*.txt      # YOLO format: class cx cy w h (normalized)
    data.yaml                     # class names + paths
  anpr/
    images/{train,val}/*.jpg
    labels/{train,val}/*.txt      # YOLO format, single class: "plate"
    data.yaml
```

### 3.2 IDD Preprocessing

1. Download IDD-Detection subset (bounding-box annotated)
2. Convert IDD's XML annotations → YOLO `.txt` labels
3. Map classes to: person, bicycle, car, motorcycle, bus, truck
4. Normalize bounding boxes to [0,1]
5. Train/val split: 85/15
6. Deduplicate near-identical dashcam frames — a difference hash compared
   against the last *kept* frame (not the previous one, so a slow pan can't
   ratchet through in sub-threshold steps). Runs in temporal order before
   the shuffle; `--dedup-distance 0` disables it.
7. **Script:** `scripts/idd_to_yolo.py`

### 3.3 ANPR Preprocessing

1. Convert both datasets to YOLO format (single class: `plate`) —
   `scripts/plates_to_yolo.py`, which reads PASCAL-VOC XML (`--format voc`,
   the Kaggle mirrors) and UFPR-ALPR's per-image `.txt` (`--format ufpr`,
   whose `position_plate` is `x y w h`, not corner-to-corner). Both write
   into one tree with per-source filename prefixes so they merge cleanly.
   UFPR's plate strings are exported as `data/anpr/plates_val.json`, which
   is the ground truth `scripts/evaluate.py anpr` scores against.
2. Apply augmentation:
   - Motion blur (kernel 3-9px)
   - Perspective warp (±15°)
   - Random brightness/contrast (±30%)
   - Downscale-then-upscale (0.5x-0.7x)
   - Gaussian/Poisson sensor noise
3. Train/val split: 80/20
4. Keep classical contour localizer as CPU fallback — done, see §5.2
5. **Script:** `scripts/anpr_augmentation.py`

### 3.4 ExDark Preprocessing

1. Map ExDark classes to target classes (ExDark covers 5 of our 6 — no truck)
2. Merge with darkened subset of IDD (gamma 0.3-0.6, noise, contrast reduction)
3. Train/val split: 80/20 — synthetic darkening is written to **train only**,
   so night metrics are measured on genuinely dark photographs
4. One model for full lighting spectrum (not separate day/night models)
5. **Script:** `scripts/exdark_to_yolo.py` (`convert` and `darken` modes)

---

## 4. Training Plan

| Model | Base | Epochs | Image Size | Batch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Detection (IDD + darkened-IDD + ExDark) | `yolov8n.pt` | 50-80, early stopping | 640 | 16 | Freeze backbone first 10 epochs, then unfreeze |
| Plate localizer | `yolov8n.pt`, single-class | 50 | 640 | 16 | Watch for overfitting on smaller dataset |

**Script:** `scripts/train.py detection` / `scripts/train.py plate`. The
detection run does the freeze warm-up as two stages automatically.

**Compute:** Free-tier Kaggle (30 GPU-hrs/week) or Google Colab T4 is
sufficient. The local dev machine has an RTX 3050 (4GB) but ships a
**CPU-only torch build**, so `--device auto` resolves to CPU until a CUDA
build is installed.

**Measured CPU rate (Ryzen 5 5600H, 12 threads): 0.29 s per image per
epoch** — 369 training images took 107 s/epoch at 640px, batch 8. That
scales the feasibility question directly:

| Dataset | Images | Per epoch | 50 epochs on CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plate localizer | 460 | ~1.8 min | ~90 min — feasible |
| IDD-Detection | ~40,000 | ~3.2 hours | ~6.7 days — **not feasible** |

So the plate model can be trained on CPU; the detector cannot. Either
install a CUDA build for the 3050, train on a deduplicated subset, or use
Kaggle's T4.

### Evaluation Metrics (for Grand Finale)

- **Detection:** mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95, broken out for day vs night subsets
- **ANPR:** Plate localization recall, end-to-end OCR exact match rate (before vs after fine-tuning)

**Script:** `scripts/evaluate.py detection` prints the day/night breakout and
the gap between them; `scripts/evaluate.py anpr` prints localization recall
and exact-match rate per localizer, so a gain can be attributed to
localization rather than to OCR (which stays unchanged EasyOCR).

## 5. Integration Plan

1. Export fine-tuned models to ONNX — `scripts/export_onnx.py`, which also
   loads the result back through onnxruntime so a broken export fails at
   export time rather than on the edge device. *Exporting is not
   benchmarking: no Jetson hardware measurement exists yet.*
2. Swap models via config flag — **done**. `BORDEREYE_DETECTION_MODEL` and
   `BORDEREYE_PLATE_MODEL` override the paths in `src/config.py`, so a live
   stock-vs-fine-tuned A/B needs no code change:
   ```
   BORDEREYE_DETECTION_MODEL=runs/detect/bordereye_detection/weights/best.pt python main.py demo
   ```
   With `BORDEREYE_PLATE_MODEL` unset, ANPR keeps the classical contour
   localizer — no model, no GPU, the Tier-2 edge path.
3. Re-run the test suite against new models — `make test`. The suite pins
   the pipeline contract (Detection → Tracker → Fence → ANPR → HashChain)
   with stubbed detections, so it catches wiring breakage from a model
   swap in ~2s without downloading anything.
4. Re-validate the detection threshold — `scripts/evaluate.py threshold`
   sweeps the confidence cutoff and reports precision/recall/F1 per value,
   so the `0.45` in `src/config.py` is re-derived rather than assumed.

---

## 7. Training Runbook (free-tier GPU)

The local dev machine has an RTX 3050 (4GB) but a **CPU-only torch build**,
so the card is unusable until a CUDA build is installed. Free-tier Kaggle
gives a T4 (16GB) and 30 GPU-hrs/week, which is both faster and larger —
prefer it over the laptop.

### 7.1 Get the data

| Dataset | How | Automatable? |
|---|---|---|
| IDD-Detection | Register at https://idd.insaan.iiit.ac.in, download the Detection subset | **No** — manual signup, start it early, approval can take days |
| Plate dataset (VOC) | `kaggle datasets download -d andrewmvd/car-plate-detection` | Yes, with `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` |
| UFPR-ALPR | Request form at https://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/databases/ufpr-alpr/ | **No** — manual request |
| ExDark | https://github.com/cs-chan/Exclusively-Dark-Image-Dataset | Yes |

### 7.2 Build the datasets

```bash
# Detection: IDD, then ExDark, then synthetic night copies
python scripts/idd_to_yolo.py --idd-root data/raw/idd_detection --out-root data/detection
python scripts/exdark_to_yolo.py convert --exdark-root data/raw/ExDark --out-root data/detection
python scripts/exdark_to_yolo.py darken --out-root data/detection --fraction 0.30

# ANPR: convert, then augment
python scripts/plates_to_yolo.py --root data/raw/car-plate-detection --format voc
python scripts/plates_to_yolo.py --root data/raw/UFPR-ALPR --format ufpr
python scripts/anpr_augmentation.py \
    --images-dir data/anpr/images/train --labels-dir data/anpr/labels/train \
    --out-dir data/anpr_augmented/train --copies-per-image 3
```

### 7.3 Train on Kaggle / Colab

Upload the built `data/detection` and `data/anpr` trees as a Kaggle Dataset
(they are far smaller than the raw downloads after conversion and dedup),
then in a GPU-enabled notebook:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/KRISHNA0R/BorderEye-Border-Intelligence-Video-Analytics-Engine.git && cd BorderEye
!pip install -q ultralytics albumentations
!python scripts/train.py detection --data /kaggle/input/bordereye-detection/data.yaml --epochs 80
!python scripts/train.py plate     --data /kaggle/input/bordereye-anpr/data.yaml      --epochs 50
```

On the laptop instead, install a CUDA torch build first and drop the batch
size — 4GB will not hold batch 16 at 640px:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
python scripts/train.py detection --batch 8
```

### 7.4 Measure, then integrate

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py detection --weights runs/detect/bordereye_detection/weights/best.pt
python scripts/evaluate.py threshold --weights runs/detect/bordereye_detection/weights/best.pt
python scripts/evaluate.py anpr --images-dir data/anpr/images/val \
    --ground-truth data/anpr/plates_val.json \
    --plate-model runs/detect/bordereye_plate/weights/best.pt
python scripts/export_onnx.py --weights runs/detect/bordereye_detection/weights/best.pt

# A/B the fine-tuned model against stock, live
BORDEREYE_DETECTION_MODEL=runs/detect/bordereye_detection/weights/best.pt python main.py demo
```

Run `evaluate.py anpr` **without** `--plate-model` first — that is the
contour-localizer baseline the fine-tuned number has to beat, and without
it the improvement cannot be attributed.
