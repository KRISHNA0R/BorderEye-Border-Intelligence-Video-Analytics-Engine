# BorderEye Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (Recommended - Free)

### Step 1: Go to Streamlit Cloud
1. Open your browser
2. Go to **https://share.streamlit.io**
3. Click **"Sign up"** (use your GitHub account)

### Step 2: Deploy the App
1. Click **"New app"** button
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository:** `KRISHNA0R/BorderEye-Border-Intelligence-Video-Analytics-Engine`
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Main file path:** `web_demo.py`
3. Click **"Deploy!"**

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- Streamlit will install dependencies automatically
- Takes about 2-3 minutes
- You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`

### Step 4: Share the URL
- Share the URL with judges
- Works on any device with a browser
- No installation needed!

## 🖥️ Run Locally (Alternative)

### Option 1: Using the start script
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run web_demo.py
```

### Option 2: Using main.py
```bash
python main.py dashboard
```

## 📱 Mobile Access

The web demo is mobile-responsive:
1. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
2. Open the URL on your phone
3. Works great for live demos!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check if all files are pushed to GitHub
2. Ensure `requirements.txt` exists at the repo root
3. Ensure `web_demo.py` is in the root directory
4. If the log shows an apt "unmet dependencies" error while processing
   `packages.txt`, it's a Community Cloud base-image issue, not your repo —
   trim `packages.txt` to just the apt packages you actually need (e.g.
   `libgl1`) and avoid `libglib2.0-0`, which currently fails to resolve.
5. **`packages.txt` must contain ONLY bare package names, one per line —
   no `#` comments, no blank lines, no punctuation like apostrophes
   anywhere in the file.** Unlike `requirements.txt` (which pip parses
   properly), Community Cloud's apt step pipes this file's tokens straight
   into `xargs apt-get install`: a `#` comment line gets passed as literal
   package names ("Unable to locate package #"), and a stray `'` anywhere
   in the file breaks `xargs`' quote parsing for the *entire* file. Put any
   explanation of why a package is there in this doc instead, not in
   `packages.txt` itself.

### If the app is slow:
- Streamlit Cloud free tier has limited resources
- For better performance, consider:
  - Streamlit Cloud Pro ($10/month)
  - Render.com (free tier available)
  - Railway.app (free tier available)

## 🌐 Alternative Deployment Options

### Render.com (Free)
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Create a new "Web Service"
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set start command: `streamlit run web_demo.py --server.port $PORT`

### Railway.app (Free)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Create a new project
3. Add a service from GitHub
4. Railway auto-detects Streamlit
